# Code editor

Code editors are powerful tools, so it is important that a good one is used, plus learn to use it effectively. 
'Try doing this:
'Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and use it for at least a week.'
    'If you find that you prefer another editor, it must provide similar performance and features as VS Code.'

## Performance

Performance is important. Your editor: 'should not hang when you open it.' 
'It should not hang when you open a project.', 'It should be responsive while editing code and switching between tabs.'
'If you have performance issues with VS Code, perhaps it's time to acquire a better computer.'
'If your computer cannot run VS Code well, Try using... [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).'

## Features

Advanced code editors can make it much easier to write correct and consistent code.

* [Autocomplete](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)
* [Advanced language features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript)
* [Code linting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

All following instructions will be for VS Code. Any editor that does not have similar configurability should be avoided.
